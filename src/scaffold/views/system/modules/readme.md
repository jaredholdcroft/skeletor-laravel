# Modules

Modules are global or reusable pairings of front-end presentation and back-end functionality. Modules do not always have admin controls, but they always have some intrinsic logic that passes down arguments from the system to something that an Component understands.

Put simply, if you can describe how a reusable component functions with content, itâ€™s probably a Module.
