# Components

Components are reusable UI patterns. As such, Components are defined by their presentation only. Unlike Modules (see below), Components are dumb. They are agnostic toward any business logic or admin functionality used to control them in the UI. Components only accept arguments and print them. Ideally their arguments are flat.
